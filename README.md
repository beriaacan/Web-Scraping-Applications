# Web Scraping Examples

This repository contains examples of web scraping that I have implemented. Below are brief descriptions of the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: [IMDb Scraper and Web Application]**
   - This project focuses on web scraping IMDb's website to gather data on the top 1000 "Anime" movies. The collected data includes movie details such as name, certificate rating, duration, genre, IMDb rating, metascore, director, stars, votes, gross earnings, and a brief plot summary. The goal is to create a dataset for further analysis, recommendations, and insights.
